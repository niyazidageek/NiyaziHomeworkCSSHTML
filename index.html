It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, along with Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook.

                 Apple Inc. had its genesis in the lifelong dream of Stephen G. Wozniak to build his own computerâ€”a dream that was made suddenly feasible with the arrival in 1975 of the first commercially successful microcomputer, the Altair 8800, which came as a kit and used the recently invented microprocessor chip. Encouraged by his friends at the Homebrew Computer Club, a San Francisco Bay area group centred around the Altair, Wozniak quickly came up with a plan for his own microcomputer.
